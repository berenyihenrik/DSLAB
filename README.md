### Temporal and Spatial Anomaly Detection

#### Definition

Develop a hybrid model for detecting anomalies in datasets with temporal and spatial components, such as traffic or climate data. The model will combine time-series analysis and spatial clustering to identify irregular patterns.  

#### Challenges

* Integrating temporal and spatial features into a cohesive modeling framework.
* Choosing effective methods for temporal and spatial anomaly detection.
* Handling the interplay of noise across temporal and spatial dimensions.

#### Objectives

1. Implement a hybrid anomaly detection model that combines temporal (e.g., time series analysis) and spatial clustering methods.
2. Test the model on spatio-temporal datasets (e.g., traffic patterns, weather anomalies).
3. Analyze and compare the performance of different approaches for temporal and spatial anomaly detection.
